# Action Conditional Semantic Segmentation Prediction

## Getting Started
This implementation is based on PyTorch 1.0
The dataset for training, validation and testing is generated by [Carla Data Collector](https://github.com/carla-simulator/data-collector)
The dataset consists of RGB, Semantic segmentation and Depth map of each frame and per frame measurement of sensors including steer, ego motion and the position of each object.

### Prerequisites
PyTorch 1.0
,Pillow
, Matplotlib
### Installing
1. Create a Anaconda3 environment with pip
2. Activate the environment
3. [install PyTorch 1.0](https://pytorch.org/)
4. Install the dependencies

## Acknowledgments
The program is developed by me and [Amir Mahdi Nassiri](https://github.com/AmirMahdiNassiri)
